BUGS:

- roll/pitch/yaw angle's don't seem right for a pixhawk in the iris. see if
  there is some obvious orthogonal rotation to get them right
- accel is not calibrated
- throttle control of motors seems to work, roll/pitch/yaw input and
  angles do not seem to change motor outputs at all
- if you attempt to arm before doing a full imu calibration, and do not put the
  system back to Safe, the arming will take effect as soon as the cal is done
(you could lose a finger)
