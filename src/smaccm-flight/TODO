BUGS:

- roll and pitch are swapped, not sure if their directions are right
- accel is not calibrated

- if you arm the fmu before you arm the io, escs wont calibrate
  until you disarm the fmu.
  require io armed first.

- if you attempt to arm before doing a full imu calibration, and do not put the
  system back to Safe, the arming will take effect as soon as the cal is done
(you could lose a finger)
